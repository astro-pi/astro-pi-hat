Event handlers for Sense Hat joystick clicks.

This event handler provides a UNIX-y interface to react to Sense Hat joystick
events.

A daemon (bin/joystick-handler) listens for joystick events using the evdev
Python library. When an event is fired, hooks in the form of executable
programs are executed and passed two command line arguments: STATE first (one
of: press, hold, release) and KEY second (one of: up, down, left, right, push).

Hooks are located in suitable /etc directories, e.g., /etc/joystick.d/press/up/
and executed using run-parts (8). See etc/joystick.d/ for a sample /etc
configuration directory hierarchy and etc/joystick.d/press/hello for a sample
hook.

A systemd unit file (etc/systemd/system/joystick-handler.service) is provided
to start the joystick handler at boot and restart it if needed.
